"""
The Syracuse (also called "Collatz" or "Hailstone") sequence is generated
by starting with a natural number and repeatedly applying the following
function until reaching 1 :

                x/2     if x is even
    syr(x) =
                3x+1    if x in odd

For example, the Syracuse sequence starting with 5 is: 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. It is
an open question in mathematics whether this sequence will always go to
1 for every possible starting value.

Write a program that gets a starting value from the user and then prints
the Syracuse sequence for that starting value.
