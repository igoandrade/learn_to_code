    <h1>History of Lawrence Hydropower</h1>
    <p>In <time datetime="yyyy">1874</time> Lawrence Kansas residents had burned all the region's wood, and fossil fuels were not avaliable. Orlando Darling built a dam across the Kansas River north of town and strung mechanical cable from a water wheel to power local industries. Justin Bowersock bought the operation naming it &quot;The Bowersock Mills &amp; Power Company&quot; (<dfn>Bowersock</dfn>). Bowersock&apos;s slogan is:</p>

    <blockquote>Producong clean, renewable hydropower since <time datetime="yyyy">1874</time>.</blockquote>

    <p><q>By <time datetime="yyyy">1885</time>, twelve water wheels drove two flouring mill, a paper mill, two elevators, a twine factory, shirt factory, two machine shops, the Leis chemical works, two printing offices, the barb wire works and a few othes minor industries... Rebuilding from the ice damage of <time datetime="yyyy">1888</time>... Bowersock introduced four dynamos that turned raw power into electrical energy.</q><cite><dfn>History of Bowersock Power</dfn></cite>. To supplement the old 2.4 <abbr title="megawatt">MW</abbr> plant on the south side of the river, Bowersock recently added a new 4.6 MW plant on the north side.</p>

    <p>To  raise funds for the new 4.6 MW plant, Bowersock signed a 25-year power-purchase agreement with Kansas City&apos;s Board od Public Utilities (<dfn>BPU</dfn>), saying <strong>Bowersock must send BPU (annual avarege power) &ge; (80&percnt; of its total generating capacity)</strong>. Instantaneous power is proporctional to (water flow rate) &times; (water height difference). Because the river&apos;s flow with rainfall, the power delivered also varies. To maximize deliverable energy. Bowersock employs a <em>run-of-the-river</em> policy. This keeps the upstream water level as high as possible and uses whatever flow occurs with the maximum ipstream level.</p>

    <p>Energy is stored in the height of the upstream water. By intentionally varying this height, Bowersock could use the stored energy to offset variation in local rate of consumption or renewable power generation. But this might compromize Bowersock&apos;s contract with BPU. Therefore: <mark>Until the BPU contract ends, energy stored in the water behind the dam is not avaliable to Lawrence.</mark></p>
